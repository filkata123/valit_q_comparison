This code is inspired by Alexander J. LaValle's [RPPL](https://github.com/alexanderjlavalle/RPPL) repository. Whatever code is copied from that repository is marked by the necessary copyright. 

*This resulting repository consists of code migrated from a [fork of RPPL](https://github.com/filkata123/RPPL) once said fork began noticably diverging from its original intention.*
